<p> Smaller class sizes in New York City Public Schools has been a long term debate for several years.<p/>
<p> In September of 2022, Governor Hochul signed a bill into effect that would cap class sizes of New York Public Schools. Kindergarten through third grade is capped at 20 students, grades four to eight at 23 students and High School classrooms at 25 students.
<p/>


<p>Educators and parents alike agree that smaller class sizes would greatly benefit the children.</p>

<p>Educator Melinda Alvarado said, â€œHaving a reduced class size would not only benefit the general education of students but even more so those who have IEPs or are ENL students."</p>

<p>However there are many unforeseen obstacles that are setting the city back from achieving these goals. Unforeseen circumstances like the New York City migrant crisis, where entire families are arriving, and therefore enrolling more students into the public school system. Other circumstances like the education budget, teacher retention rates and so on.<p/>
